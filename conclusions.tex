This thesis explores properties of the ramping parameter model~\cite{Sindel:2009} for graph models.
In particular, the random graph model by~\cite{} and the configuration model were explored.


The random 



state the assumptions of the thesis

state the results

Open points

- what if the graph is directed?

- what if the graph is not power law?



Further work


Generating functions open the door to dealing with directed graphs with other degree distributions
