\chapter{Graphs and networks}

In general, the complex networks - networks of both randomness and structure - studied in this article can be represented by an undirected and unweighed graph:
\begin{equation}
G = (V,E)	
\end{equation}
, where $V$ is the set of vertices (or nodes), and $E$ is the set of edges (or links).

Each edge connects exactly one pair of vertices, and a vertex-pair can be connected by maximally one edge, i.e., multi-connection is not allowed.
Let furthermore $N$ denote the number of vertices $N = |V|$ and $L$ the number of edges $L = |E|$.

For a social network [9], $V$ is a set of persons (or "actors" in sociology parlance) and $E$ is the set of acquaintance ties that links the persons together.
In computer networks $V$ represent the routers or computers and $E$ the channels for computer communication.

\section{Random graph model} % (fold)
\label{sec:random_graph_model}



One of the models of network formation is the original random-graph model.
This model was studied extensively by the Hungarian mathematicians Paul Erd\"os (1913–1996) and Alfr\'ed R\'enyi (1921–1970), and was responsible for a large corpus of research on random graphs
In the random graph model, a graph has $n$ vertices or nodes, and for every pair of nodes $i, j$, an edge exists with probability $p$.
It is usually denoted by $G(n, p)$, and defines a distribution of graphs $P(G)$.
As with other models studied in this thesis, statements made about the model are statements made about the collection of graphs, rather than any specific instance of a graph.


\subsection{Mean degree and degree distribution} % (fold)
\label{ssub:mean_degree_and_degree_distribution}


In the random graph model, the existence of any edge is independent from each other and solely determined by the same probability value $p$.
As such, the probability of a graph with $m$ edges drawn from the $G(n,p)$ model is given by a binomial distribution choosing $m$ edges out of a universe of $\binom{n}{2}$ edges
\begin{equation}
	P(m) = \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{m} p^m (1-p)^{\binom{n}{2}-m}
\end{equation}
Using the binomial theorem, 
\begin{equation}
	\mean{m} = \sum^{\binom{n}{2}}_{m=0} P(m) = \binom{n}{2} p
\end{equation}

In the course of this document, we will be not only interested on the properties of the graph itself, but also on how they build from the individual properties of the edges and nodes.
Under the $G(n,m)$, the mean degree of a vertex is
\begin{equation}
	\mean{k} = \sum^{\binom{n}{2}}_{m=0} \frac{2m}{n} P(m)
\end{equation}

The configuration model is one of the most popular null models for the study of the statistical properties of networks.
It is inspired

\section{Generating functions} % (fold)
\label{sec:generating_functions}



We assume throughout this chapter that  follow~\cite{Newman:zFi032Kd}, which defines a set of generating functions for the probability distributions of some of the statistical properties of the graphs.
The basis of these is the function $G_0(x)$ for the probability distribution of vertex degrees $k$, defined as
\begin{equation}
G_0(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k x^k
\end{equation}
where $p_k$ is the probability that a given vertex of the graph has degree $k$.

- normalization assumption ($G_0(1) = 1$)
- $G_0(x)$ is finite for all $|x| \le 1$

The derivatives of this function can be used to derive other statistical quantities.
For example, one can recover the probability $p_k$ by taking the $k^{th}$ derivative of the $G_0$
\begin{equation}
	p_k = \frac{1}{k!} \frac{d^k G_0}{dx^k} \Big|_{x=0}.
\end{equation}

Furthermore, one can obtain the average degree $z$ of the nodes in a graph 
\begin{equation}
	z = \mean{k} = \sum_k k p_k = G'_0(1)
\end{equation}

The function is given by the polylogarithm function
\begin{equation}
	\poly{n}{z} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k^n}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Component sizes} % (fold)
\label{ssub:component_sizes}

$H_1(x)$ follows the recursive condition
\begin{equation}
	H_1(x) = x G_1( H_1(x))
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\mean{s} = 1 + \frac{G'_0(1)}{1-G'_1(1)}	
\end{equation}


For a power law graph, this is given by
\begin{equation}
	G_1(x) = \frac{\poly{\tau-1}{xe^{-1/\kappa}}}{x\poly{\tau-1}{e^{-1/\kappa}}}
\end{equation}
and therefore
\begin{equation}
	G'_1(x) = \frac{\operatorname{Li}_{s - 2} \left(x e^{- 1/\kappa}\right)}
	               {x^{2} \operatorname{Li}_{s - 1}\left(e^{- 1/\kappa}\right)} -
	          \frac{\operatorname{Li}_{s - 1}\left(x e^{- 1/\kappa}\right)}
	               {x^{2} \operatorname{Li}_{s - 1}\left(e^{- 1/\kappa}\right)}
\end{equation}
