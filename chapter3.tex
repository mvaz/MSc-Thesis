\chapter{Ramping parameter under the random graph model} % (fold)
\label{cha:ramping_parameter_under_the_random_graph_model}

Previous work~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} provided a connection between the clustered structure of a graph and an interpretation of concentration risk.
The methodology presented by the authors considered the effects of removing edges with weight under given a varying threshold on the community structure of a fully connected obligor-correlation matrix.
In particular, by computing the variation of the component structure of the graph, the authors have shown how to analyse concrete credit portfolios and identify sets of highly connect assets.


This thesis builds upon the aforementioned model and aims at describing the expected behaviour of the ramping parameter model for theoretical graph generation models.
In this chapter, we focus on the random graph model, a well understood theoretical graph model, described in section~\vref{sec:random_graph_model}.

In particular, it tries to describe the expected behaviour of the curve designed by the~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} the problem from the perspective of having
large, idealized portfolios 
and a random graph model that generates them.





\section{The ramping parameter model} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_ramping_parameter_model}


The approach proposed by~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} for quantifying the concentration risk of a loan portfolio works can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The mutual dependency between the obligors in a portfolio is represented by a matrix $\rho_{ij}$. This matrix is symmetric, the values $\rho_{ij} \in [0,1]$, and it will be called correlation matrix throughout the remainder of this document.
	\item A so-called ramping parameter $\ramp \in [0,1]$ is used to define the effective correlation matrix $\rho_{ij}(\ramp)$ given the value of this  parameter:
	\begin{equation}
	\rho_{ij}(\ramp) = 
		\begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if } \rho_{ij} \ge \ramp,\\
		0 \text{ otherwise}.
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	At $\ramp = 0$, the effective matrix will contain all connections in the original matrix. At $\ramp = 1$, all obligors in the effective matrix will be disconnected.
	
	\item The exposure-dependence is taken into account by computing the “effective” exposure for every value of $\ramp$.
\end{itemize}


To properly account for the Concentration Risk we compute the ratio $R(ρ∗)$ of the maximum of all exposures of all identified connected components $C_k$ and the total exposure of the portfolio
of the portfolio and $j$ runs over all loans within the connected component $C_k$.

	$M \gets \textrm{compute the obligor correlation matrix as shown in eq~\ref{}}$

	$R(\rho_*) \gets \max_{C_k} \left(  \frac{\sum_{j\in C_k} \textrm{EAD}_j}{\sum_i \textrm{EAD}_i}  \right)$

\EndFor
\end{algorithm}

In the following lines we briefly describe the algorithm we propose for quantifying the Concentration Risk CR of a loan portfolio. 

2. For each value of ρ∗ we compute the effective (inter) obligor-correlation matrix as shown in Eq. 3.2.
3. We compute the number of connected components and the corresponding obli- gation in each component of the graph for every value of ρ∗.4
4. To properly account for the Concentration Risk we compute the ratio R(ρ∗) of the maximum of all exposures of all identified connected components Ck and the total exposure of the portfolio
of the portfolio and j runs over all loans within the connected component Ck.

In Eq. (3.3) i runs over all loans of the portfolio, i EADi is the total obligation
Note that R(ρ∗) describes the risk of a portfolio associated with the default of its biggest clump for a given ρ∗. The risk related to a correlated default of the two biggest clumps - which has a very small probability - is not included in equation (3.3). Of course one could account for such scenarios in R(ρ∗) as well by adjusting formula (3.3). As correlated defaults are exponentially suppressed we do not incorporate them in
