I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Peter Gl\"ossner for the suggestion of the topic, for his guidance and valuable comments, as well as for the open and inspiring discussion rounds that lead to this thesis.

I extend my sincere thanks to Dr. Michael Monoyios, University of Oxford, who was always very cooperative and interested.

Several colleagues at d-fine GmbH gave me useful hints in the progress of preparing this thesis.
In particular I would like to thank Dr. Anne Kleppe, who provided insight and data, and Dr. Walter Freyn, who provided helpful feedback.

I am much obliged to d-fine GmbH for supporting my studies at the University of Oxford in the part time Mathematical Finance program.

Finally, I would like to thank my family, Anne and Leo, for putting up with me during my studies at Oxford. Merci!
