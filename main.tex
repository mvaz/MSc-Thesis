\chapter{Introduction}



Banking regulators (Basel II) require market participants to identify and monitor concentration risk in their credit portfolios.
Concentration risk is the risk arising from high exposure to single risk factors.
Standard concentration measures rely mainly on the aggregation of the measures of each portfolio element at, for example, the economic sector of activity~\cite{lutkebohmert2008concentration}.
While these models performs well at predefined aggregation levels, they usually underestimate direct obligor-specific economic links and, possibly, the latent dependency structure of the portfolio.
The importance of structural measures has been confirmed by recent financial events, where large losses arising from worldwide contagion effects were registered~\cite{Kazi:2013vr}.
	
Network models are especially apt at identifying structural properties~\cite{newman2010networks}, as they take not only model the elements of a system (the nodes or vertices) but also the relations between those elements (the edges).
Network models are proving to be useful tools for providing early-warning signals of systemic risk~\cite{Squartini:2013ev}, measuring liquidity risk~\cite{Karas:2012tp}, identifying sectors from time-series correlations~\cite{Onnela:2004vz,Fenn:2009uf,Fenn:2011kp}, as well as insights into finding diversified baskets of assets in the classical investment framework~\cite{Pozzi:2013ci}.
Many other use cases are described in the recent book~\cite{Soramaki2016}.

Previous work on concentration risk relied on a network intepretation of a portfolio~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} by using a varying (ramping) parameter for progressively eliminating interdependencies between obligors, and analysed the relative exposure size of the component with largest exposure.
Using a weight function, this relative exposure size is integrated over all parameter values in order to measure the portfolio's concentration risk.

While this method is able to measure properties of specific portfolios, little is hitherto know about the expected properties of the model for a given portfolios.
% The expected properties could prove helpful to help identify idiosyncrasies of the model's behaviour on the specific portfolio at hand.
The main goal of this thesis is to connect ramping parameter model with theoretical work behind random graphs.
For this, we study the properties of the ramping parameter under the most widely theoretical graph model: the random graph model described by~\cite{erdos1959random}.
Firstly, having the model inspected theoretically allows for a better understanding of its properties.
Secondly, even though the theoretical models do not capture all the properties of real world graphs, it provides useful baselines for comparison with the results with real portfolios.


% The main goal of this thesis is to address the computational complexity of the method by providing a link to other common structural graph measures, e.g. eigenvector centrality, and financial specific measures, such as Debt-Rank~\citep{Puliga:2012ev} which models contagion effects from interdependencies of financial institutions.
% In order to do so, we will first study the properties of different theoretical network formation models (e.g. Watts–Strogatz model~\citep{Watts:1998db}.
% In a second stage, real credit portfolios will be used. Should time permit, the effect of different types of interdependencies will be studied by means of multilayer networks~\citep{Kivela:2014dm}.



\section{Credit concentration risk} % (fold)
\label{sec:credit_concentration_risk}

Under Basel II~\cite{basel2007explanatory}, banks are required to compute the capital requirements for their credit portfolios using the ASFR (Asymptotic Single Risk Factor)~\cite{}, and are allowed to use their own internal risk measurements - IRB approach.
The ASRF model is based on the results from~\cite{vasicek1991limiting} depends on three main quantities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[PD] the Probability of Default: the probability that a considered obligor will default within the next 12 months,
	\item[LGD] Loss Given Default: the expected fractional loss in case of the obligor's default,
	\item[EAD] Exposure At Default: the expected exposure an obligor has when the default event occurs as seen from today.
\end{itemize}
While we urge the reader to refer to~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} for a more comprehensive description of the meaning of the quantities and how these are combined in the model, it is important to state that the ASRF model makes two important assumptions on the portfolios: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item they are perfectly fine grained, thereby containing no idiosyncratic risk, i.e. no Concentration Risk
	\item there is only one source of systematic risk.
\end{enumerate}
In order to circumvent this limitation, the concentration risk, i.e. the probability of losses arising from an outstanding credit exposure to a given set of counterparties through some common risk factors, is accounted for by the so-called granularity adjustment (GA)~\cite{lutkebohmert2008concentration}.

We outline the different strategies behind the existing methodologies for assessing the Concentration Risk
\begin{itemize}
	\item concentration of absolute exposure, e.g. by means of the HHI (Herfindahl-Hischmann Index)
	\item a measurement of relative exposure concentrations, e.g. by using the Lorenz-Curve
	\item comparison with a given benchmark portfolio
\end{itemize}
As can be seen, the first two measures here rely solely on the exposure structure of the portfolio.
The measure proposed by~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} goes beyond this by relying on both the exposure- and the correlation-structure of the portfolio.

\section{The ramping parameter model} % (fold)
\label{sec:ramping_parameter}

The ramping parameter model was developed in~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} and aims at assessing the concentration risk in real world loan portfolios. 
In contrast to other methods for studying concentration risk, the ramping parameter takes into account both, the exposure- and the dependency-structure of the portfolio.
A particular strength of this methodology is that it can be used universally.
% Through the course of this thesis, the 

The ramping parameter monitors how the component structure - notably the component with largest exposure - of a graph representing the considered portfolio develops, as edges are removed increasingly according to their strength.
% It computes a curve that parameterizes the dependency of the effective exposure on the ramping parameter.
We begin by defining some quantitites.

\begin{definition}{Portfolio}
A credit portfolio is a tuple $(O, \rmat)$, where $O$ is a set of $n$ exposures from $n$ different obligors and $C$ an $n \times n$ matrix.
The $\rmat$ matrix represents the interdependency (or correlation) between each obligors $i$ and $j$, and each element $\rij \in [0,1]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Throughout this work, the matrix $\rmat$ is symmetric, so that $\forall i,j \rij = \rji$, the values of $\rij \in [0,1]$ and $\rii = 0$.
Even though in the real world the dependency between obligors is not necessarily symmetric, e.g. in the case where obligor $i$ is a subsidiary of obligor $j$, the symmetry assumption renders the model more analytically tractable.
% Also, for reasons related to the analytical tractability of the model, the exposures are assumed to be equal amongst obligors.
\end{remark}



The approach proposed by~\cite{Sindel:2009vd} for quantifying the concentration risk of a loan portfolio works can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The mutual dependency between the obligors in a portfolio is represented by a matrix $C$.
	This matrix will be referred to through the document as correlation or interdependency matrix.
	This matrix is symmetric, its values lie $c_{ij} \in [0,1]$~\footnote{this thesis relaxes the interpretation and the domain of the values, but still follows the original definition}.

	\item A so-called ramping parameter $\ramp \in [0,1]$ is used to define the effective correlation, or adjacency matrix $A(\ramp)$ given the value of this  parameter:
	\begin{equation}
	a_{ij}(\ramp) = 
		\begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if } c_{ij} \ge \ramp,\\
		0 \text{ otherwise}.
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	At $\ramp = 0$, the effective matrix will contain all connections in the original matrix. At $\ramp = 1$, all obligors in the effective matrix $A$ will be disconnected.
	
	\item The exposure-dependence is taken into account by computing the largest “effective” exposure for every value of $\ramp$.
	In particular, the ratio $R(\ramp)$ of the maximum of all exposures of all identified connected components $C_k$ and the total exposure of the portfolio is computed. Concretely this means the following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item compute the set of $k$ connected components $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ of the graph $G$ defined by the adjacency matrix $A(\ramp)$~\footnote{A definition of these terms is provided in~\ref{cha:graphs_and_networks}}, which effectively is a partition of the set of obligors,
		\item compute $R(\ramp) = \max_{C_k} \left(  \frac{\sum_{j\in C_k} \textrm{EAD}_j}{\sum_i \textrm{EAD}_i}  \right)$, where $C_k$ is a connected component
	\end{enumerate}
	$R(\ramp)$ describes the risk of a portfolio associated with the default of its biggest clump for a given $\ramp$
 
	\item The concentration risk $CR$ is determined by considering the area under a curve weighted by $P(\ramp)$, so that 
	\begin{equation}
	 	CR = \int_0^1 R(\ramp)P(\ramp)d\ramp
	 	\label{eq:ramping_integral}
	 \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The original work experiments with several possible values for the weighted curve.
In the context of this thesis, the consideration of a weighted curve is postponed for future work.
Indeed, we see the results from this work as a possible contribution to determining a weighted curve that accounts for the expected distribution of $R(\ramp)$.

Stylized portfolio with six obligors (A, B, C, D, E, and F).
The relative strength of the inter-obligor connections $\rho_{ij}$ is illustrated by the line-width.
In the left figure, the interdependency between customer $D$ and the other customers is rather small.
Additional to the individual inter-customer correlation each customer also has an individual obligation (symbolized by the differently coloured circles), indicated as $O_i$, $i \in \{A, B, C, D, E, F \}$.
Both the obligation of the individual customer $O_i$ and the inter-customer correlations $\rho_{ij}$ are required to compute the Concentration Risk as suggested by our measure.
For a particular value of the correlation strength obligor $D$ becomes independent from all other obligors of the portfolio.

\section{Random graph models} % (fold)
\label{sec:random_graph_models}

Random graph models are widely used to understand the properties of real world networks~\cite{newman2002random}.
They provide a means of generating and analysing networks with statistical properties that resemble those of real-world networks.
The most popular random graph model is credited to %Paul Erd\"os and Alfr\'ed R\'enyi
~\cite{erdos1959random}.
One reason for its popularity is the fact that it is very simple (and analytically tractable).
Although its properties do not necessarily resemble those observed in social, financial or technical ecosystems, its dynamics already capture a very interesting phenomenon that is also relevant for this thesis: the emergence of a so-called giant component.

A connected component is a set of nodes, between which there is always a connecting path.
The giant component is a connected component for which the fraction of nodes it contains remains constant as the network grows in size.
It is also the largest component in the graph, and can be usually seen in many real world networks~\footnote{For example, in the case of the internet network, the existence of a giant component is extremely important, as it guarantees that as much nodes (computers) as possible can communicate with each otgher}.
Not only its existence is of interest, but the emergence of the giant component is an important phenomenon.
It emerges almost spontaneously as the edge density reaches a critical value, leading to a phase transition, as explained by~\cite{newman2002random}.
This can also be seen in Figure~\vref{fig:giant_component}
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=13.5cm]{figures/giant_component.png}
	\caption[Sudden appearance of the giant component in a random graph]{This figure illustrates the sudden appearance of a giant connected component (lower plots) in the random graph model. The graphs, each with $n=200$ nodes are generated randomly, with a mean degree of $c$ and an edge probability $p$. The random graph model predicts a giant component when $c\ge1$}
	\label{fig:giant_component}
\end{figure}

One important property where the random graph model does not mimic the real world networks is the distribution of a node's degree.
The degree is a property of the node in a graph that describes how many connections (or how important these connections are) the node has to the other nodes in the graph.
Real-world networks tend to have heavy tailed distributions, where as the random graph model has a binomial distribution / Poisson distribution.
One of the these heavy tail distributions is the power law distribution, which is scale-free, as was and was shown by~\cite{Albert:2002p4071} to lead to the so-called small world phenomenon~\cite{Watts:1998db}.


% A second way in which random graphs differ from their real-world counterparts is in their degree distributions, a point which has been emphasized particularly in the work of Albert, Baraba ́si, and collaborators (Albert et al., 1999; Baraba ́si and Albert, 1999). The probability pk that a vertex in an Erd ̋os–R ́enyi random graph has degree exactly k is given by the binomial distribution:

\section{Organisation of this document} % (fold)
\label{sec:organisation_of_this_document}

This document is organized as follows.
Chapter~\ref{cha:graphs_and_networks} describes the fundamental concepts of graph theory and of the random graph model.
The random graph model provides a statistical description of the degree distribution and the component structure of random graphs, which may include both a giant component and a set of small components.
The component structure is of high relevance for providing a connection to the ramping parameter model described in section~\ref{sec:ramping_parameter}.

In chapter~\ref{cha:ramping_parameter_under_the_random_graph_model}, we described expected properties of the ramping parameter in the case of random graphs.
This connection, based on the expected component structure, provides useful information to better understand the behaviour of the ramping parameter model for the estimation of credit concentration risk in real-world portfolios.

We finalize in chapter~\ref{cha:discussion} by providing a summary of the results of this thesis and a discussion of possible continuations of this work.
Software code used throughout this thesis is provided in the appendix.
